## Getting started

If you want to use this tool, you can follow below steps:
1. Preparing a computer or laptop like Macbook or Windows laptop
2. Install python as this code is developed by python
3. Using git to clone this source code
4. Using the "poetry shell" command in the source code directory and the poetry environment will be prepared
5. Using the "poetry install" command to install related packages for this tool
6. Using the "python aura.py" to execute this tool

## How it works and what is its purpose?
It will generate a frequency(Hz) which you assigned in code and play the frequency for about 30 seconds. After hearing the frequency, it will play a sound with a human voice. I assumed that you should be able to understand the meaning which you hear about the human voice as your pineal gland is activated by the frequency.

## Experience sharing
According to my personal experience about this tool, it doesn't work as I expected.
I can't understand the meaning of the human voice.
Therefore, using sound frequency to activate the pineal gland and have a short ability to understand all languages is not work at this moment.
